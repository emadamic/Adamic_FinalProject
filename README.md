# Adamic_FinalProject

This is my final project for Biol 7863. 

DESCRIPTION: 
This Python script takes an Excel file (.xlsx) as input, containing subject repsonse data for the Visceral Interoceptive Awareness brain imaging task.
This Excel file MUST have the following format: 

- one sheet for each imaging run 
- one row for each event (4 conditions (heart, lung, stomach, target) x 3 trials each = 12 rows total)
- one column for each subject (after the first column, labelled "Event") 

INSTRUCTIONS: 
This Python script is run via the command line. 

>> Navigate to directory containing the script, and the data file
